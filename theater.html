        <h3>THE WEDDING - Anton Chekov</h3>
        <p><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> [Looks round the table and counts up the covers]
            One, two, three, four, five...<br>
            
            <br><b>A WAITER.</b> The cook asks if you would like the ices served with rum,
            madeira, or by themselves?<br>
            
            <br><b>APLOMBOV.</b> With rum. And tell the manager that there's not enough wine.
            Tell him to prepare some more Haut Sauterne. [To NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA]
            You also promised and agreed that a general was to be here to supper.
            And where is he?<br>
            
            <br><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> That isn't my fault, my dear.<br>
            
            <br><b>APLOMBOV.</b> Whose fault, then?<br>
            
            <br><b>NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</b> It's Andrey Andreyevitch's fault.... Yesterday he
            came to see us and promised to bring a perfectly real general. [Sighs] I
            suppose he couldn't find one anywhere, or he'd have brought him....
            You think we don't mind? We'd begrudge our child nothing. A general, of
            course...<br>
            
            <br><b>APLOMBOV.</b> But there's more.... Everybody, including yourself, _maman_,
            is aware of the fact that Yats, that telegraphist, was after Dashenka
            before I proposed to her. Why did you invite him? Surely you knew it
            would be unpleasant for me? <br>
